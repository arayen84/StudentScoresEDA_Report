# Report on Student Scores Dataset

## Introduction:
This report provides insights into a dataset containing information about student scores. The data was obtained from Kaggle and consists of various attributes such as math scores, physics scores, chemistry scores, gender, and whether the student has a part-time job.


## Data Exploration:

The dataset was imported into a Pandas DataFrame.
Basic information about the dataset was examined using functions like .head(), .tail(), .shape, .describe(), and .info() to understand its structure, size, and summary statistics.
Missing values were identified using .isnull().sum().


## Data Analysis:

The frequency of part-time jobs among students was analyzed using .value_counts() on the "part_time_job" column.
Seaborn was utilized for data visualization:
Distribution plots (displot) were created to visualize the distribution of math scores by gender and physics scores by gender.
A kernel density estimation plot (kde) was generated to explore the relationship between physics scores and chemistry scores, with gender as a hue.
An empirical cumulative distribution function plot (ecdf) was used to visualize the distribution of physics scores by gender.


## Conclusion:

The dataset provides valuable insights into student performance and demographics.
Further analysis and modeling could be conducted to understand the factors influencing student scores and academic achievement.
